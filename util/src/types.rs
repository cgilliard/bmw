/// # Sizing
///
/// It is important to configure this hashtable correctly and to do so, the user must
/// understand how the data are stored. Each hashtable is configured with an associated
/// [`crate::SlabAllocator`] and that slab allocator has a specific size for each slab.
/// The hashtable will only store a single entry in a slab. No slab contains data from
/// multiple entries. So, if you have a large slab size and small entries, you will be
/// wasting space. If your data is fixed in size, you can calculate an optimal slab size,
/// but if it is variable, it is probably better to use smaller slabs so that less space
/// is left empty. The slab layout looks like this:
///
/// [ ptr_size bytes for next iterator list]
/// [ ptr_size bytes for prev iterator list]
/// [ hashtable key ]
/// [ hashtable value ]
/// ... (empty space if the slab is not filled up)
/// [ ptr_size bytes for key/value list ]
///
/// where ptr_size is determined by the size of the entry array. The minimum number of
/// bytes will be used. So, if you have an entry array that is length less than 256
/// ptr_size will be 1 byte. If you have an entry array that is length less than
/// 65,536 but greater than or equal to 256, ptr_size will be 2 and so on. If the
/// data for the entry only takes up one slab, the key/value list is not used, but
/// if the data takes up more than one slab, the key/value list will point to the next
/// slab in the list. So, if your key is always 8 bytes and your value is always 8 bytes
/// and you have an entry array size of 100,000 (ptr_size = 3 bytes), you can will need
/// a total of 9 bytes overhead for the three pointers and you will need 16 bytes for your
/// data. So you can size your hashtable at 25 bytes.
///
/// Note: your entry array size is ceil(the max_entries / max_load_factor).
